'Our capacity to draw happiness from aesthetic objects or material goods in fact seems critically dependent,on our first satisfying a more important range of emotional or psychological needs, among them the need for understanding for love expression and respect.', 
'The true secret of happiness lies in the taking a genuine interest in all the details of daily life.',
'The greatest happiness you can have is knowing that you do not necessarily require happiness.',
'People should find happiness in the little things, like family.', 
'To enjoy good health, to bring true happiness to one’s family, to bring peace to all, one must first discipline and control one’s own mind. If a man can control his mind he can find the way to Enlightenment, and all wisdom and virtue will naturally come to him.',
'There is some kind of a sweet innocence in being human—in not having to be just happy or just sad—in the nature of being able to be both broken and whole, at the same time.',
'Even a happy life cannot be without a measure of darkness, and the word happy would lose its meaning if it were not balanced by sadness.', 
'It is far better to take things as they come along with patience and equanimity.', 
'If you want happiness for an hour, take a nap.',
'If you want happiness for a day, go fishing. If you want happiness for a year, inherit a fortune.',
'If you want happiness for a lifetime, help someone else.']
